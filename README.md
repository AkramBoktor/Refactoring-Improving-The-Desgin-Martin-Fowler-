# Refactoring-Improving-The-Desgin-Martin-Fowler
# Chapter 2 ( Principle in Refactoring )
- Refactor improves the deso=ign of the software
- Refactor makes software easier to understand
- Refactor help you to find bugs
- refactor help you prgram faster
# When you sholuld refactor ?
- should we allocate two weeks every couple of months to refactoring ?
- No you refactor because you want to do something and refactoring helps you do that other things
# three strikes and you refactor 
. Refactor when you add fuction 
. Refactor when you need to fix a bug
. Refactor as you do a code review
# Problems with refactoring
. Database 
change the database schema force you to migrate the data so to deal with this problem you need to seperate layer of software
between your object model and your databse model .
As you update one model you don't need to update another you just update an intermediate layer . such this layer add more complexity but give
you more flexiability 
# When shouldn't you refactor ?
when you need to create a code from scratch . 
when you are close to the deadline . At this point the productivity again from refactoring would appear after the deadline and thus be too late .
